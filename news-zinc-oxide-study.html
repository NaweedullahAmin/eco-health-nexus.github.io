    <h2>Research Overview</h2>
    <p>This comprehensive study investigated how varying salinity levels affect the toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles on aquatic organisms. Using Javanese Medaka (Oryzias javanicus) as our model organism, we conducted extensive experiments to understand the interaction between environmental factors and nanoparticle toxicity.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Salinity Protection:</strong> Elevated salinity levels significantly reduced the toxic effects of ZnO nanoparticles on fish embryo development</li>
        <li><strong>Dose-Response Relationship:</strong> Clear correlation between nanoparticle concentration and developmental abnormalities</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Implications:</strong> Findings suggest that salinity variations in aquatic ecosystems can naturally mitigate nanoparticle toxicity</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Provides valuable data for environmental risk assessment frameworks</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The research employed state-of-the-art techniques including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advanced nanoparticle characterization using XRD, TEM, and DLS</li>
        <li>Comprehensive toxicity testing across multiple salinity gradients</li>
        <li>Statistical analysis using Python and SPSS for robust data interpretation</li>
        <li>Long-term monitoring of developmental endpoints</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Significance and Impact</h2>
    <p>This research represents a significant advancement in our understanding of how environmental factors modulate nanoparticle toxicity. The findings have important implications for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Environmental regulation of nanomaterials</li>
        <li>Development of safer nanoparticle applications</li>
        <li>Aquatic ecosystem protection strategies</li>
        <li>Future research directions in nanotoxicology</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The publication marks an important contribution to the field of environmental toxicology and reinforces our research group's commitment to addressing pressing environmental challenges through rigorous scientific investigation.</p>
